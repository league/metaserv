                   --------------------------------

These are some preliminary notes about running and hacking on
MetaOCaml Server Pages.  See the paper for more details on how it
works, and ask me if you don't understand something; I'm happy to
cooperate and collaborate.

Building should be almost this easy:

$ darcs get http://comsci.liu.edu/~league/dist/metaserv/trunk metaserv
$ cd metaserv
$ make all
$ make run

Wait for it to say "Ready...", and then open your browser to
http://localhost:1090/
to see the demo.

Caveats:

Give it a C-c (or kill -INT) to trigger a server shutdown.

1. It probably requires GNU make.

2. You will need metaocaml already installed, AND *SML/NJ* (I used it  
to write the translator, since I didn't feel like learning the OCaml  
version of Lex and Yacc).  The makefile has variables METADIR and SML.

It has been tested most recently with
 * MetaOCaml version 3.09.1 alpha 030, and
 * Standard ML of New Jersey v110.60

3. It works for me on both linux/x86 and mac/ppc.

4. The hackiness I mentioned before is mostly embodied in the scripts/ 
run file, which is created by make.  Just look at the rule to create  
it, starting at Makefile:256... UGLY.  Can explain later.

5. There are probably more that I can't remember at the moment...
